The `custom-callout` extension provides a YAML interface to configure a Quarto Callout Block with custom values.

## Installing

To install the `custom-callout` extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your Quarto project directory.
3. Execute the following command:

```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/customcallout
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

The `custom-callout` extension allows you to define custom callouts in your YAML front matter and then use them in your Quarto documents.
Here's a quick overview of the available YAML options:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `title` | Default title for the callout (optional) | `title: "Important Note"` |
| `icon` | Use a default icon (optional) | `icon: true` |
| `icon-symbol` | Custom symbol or text for the icon | `icon-symbol: "üìù"` |
| `color` | Color for the callout's left border and icon | `color: "#FFA500"` |
| `appearance` | Callout appearance (optional) | `appearance: simple` |
| `collapse` | Make the callout collapsible (optional) | `collapse: true` |

You can start using custom callouts in your Quarto project immediately after installation. First, define your custom callouts in the YAML front matter:

```yaml
custom-callout:
  todo:
    icon-symbol: "üìù"
    color: "pink"
  test:
    title: "Testing Note"
    icon-symbol: "‚ö†Ô∏è"
    color: "#FFA500"
filters:
- custom-callout
```


Then, use the custom callouts in your Markdown content:

```markdown
::: todo
Remember to complete this section.
:::

::: test
This information is crucial for understanding the concept.
:::
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of custom callouts in action:

::: {.todo}
This is a custom 'todo' callout with a pink border and a pencil icon.
:::

::: {.test}
This is a custom 'test' callout with an orange border and a warning icon.
