## What is the custom-callout extension?

The custom-callout extension is a Quarto filter that allows you to create and use custom callouts in your Quarto documents.
It extends the built-in callout functionality, enabling you to define your own callout types with custom colors, icons, and appearances.

:::{.callout-important}
The custom-callout extension only works with Quarto HTML documents currently. We're looking into expanding support for other output formats in the future.

## How do I install the custom-callout extension?

To use the custom-callout extension, you need to:

1. Download and install the Quarto extension from GitHub by running the following command in your Termainal:

```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/custom-callout
```

2. Add `custom-callout` to the `filters` list in your YAML front matter or `_quarto.yml` file.

3. Define your custom callouts in the YAML front matter of your Quarto document or in your `_quarto.yml` file.



## How do I define custom callouts?

Define custom callouts in the YAML front matter of your Quarto document or in your `_quarto.yml` file using the `custom-callout` key. For example:

```yaml
custom-callout:
  todo:
    icon-symbol: "üìù"
    color: "pink"
  bug:
    title: "Bug Report"
    icon: false
    color: "#FFA500"

filters:
- custom-callout
```


## What options can I set for each custom callout?

For each custom callout, you can set the following options:

- `title`: The default title for the callout (optional)
- `icon`: Set to `true` to use a default icon, or omit for no icon
- `icon-symbol`: A custom symbol or text to use as the icon
- `color`: The color for the callout's left border and icon (can be a named color or hex code)
- `appearance`: The callout appearance (optional)
- `collapse`: Whether the callout should be collapsible (optional)

## How do I use a custom callout in my document?

Use custom callouts in your Markdown content with the following syntax:

```markdown
::: todo
This is a todo item.
:::

::: bug
Please fix this issue.
:::
```

::: todo
This is a todo item.
:::

::: bug
Please fix this issue.
:::

## Can I override a property for a specific callout instance?

Yes, you can override various properties title for a specific callout instance by adding them as attributes to the callout block. 

For example, to set a custom title for a todo item, you can use the `title` attribute:

```markdown
::: {.todo title="Urgent Task"}
This needs to be done ASAP.
:::
```

::: {.todo title="Urgent Task"}
This needs to be done ASAP.
:::

## Do custom callouts support collapsible content?

Yes, custom callouts support collapsible content. You can set the `collapse` option to `true` in your callout definition to make it collapsible.

## Can I use custom callouts alongside built-in Quarto callouts?

Yes, you can use custom callouts alongside Quarto's built-in callouts. The custom-callout extension doesn't interfere with the standard callout syntax.

## How are custom callout styles applied?

The extension automatically generates CSS for your custom callouts based on the defined colors and icons. 
This CSS is included in the document's header, ensuring that your custom callouts are styled correctly.

## What if I want to change the appearance of all my custom callouts?

You can modify the `generateCustomCSS` function in the `custom-callout.lua` file to change the default styling for all custom callouts.
However, be careful when making changes to the Lua script, as it may affect the functionality of the extension.
Alternatively, you can add custom CSS to your document to override the default styles.

## Is this extension compatible with all Quarto output formats?

The custom-callout extension is primarily designed for HTML output. While it may work with other formats to some extent, 
the full range of customization options (especially custom icons and colors) might not be available in non-HTML outputs.


## How does the custom-callout extension compare to the quarto-custom-numbered-blocks extension?

The [quarto-custom-numbered-blocks](https://github.com/ute/custom-numbered-blocks) extension by [Ute Hahn](https://github.com/ute) is a complementary tool that offers different functionality:

- It creates numbered blocks (e.g., theorems, examples) with automatic numbering and cross-referencing.
- Features include: 
  - Automatic numbering and cross-referencing
  - Grouping of block types with shared styling and numbering
  - Generation of lists of specific block types
  - Support for both PDF and HTML output
- This makes it great for academic or technical documents requiring numbered theorems, examples, or exercises.

Both extensions can be used in the same document if needed, but be mindful of potential styling conflicts and filter ordering.
