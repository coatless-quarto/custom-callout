| `color` | Color for the callout's left border and background | None | Any valid CSS color name or hex | `color: "#FFA500"` |
| `appearance` | Callout appearance | `"default"` | `"default"`, `"simple"`, `"minimal"` | `appearance: "simple"` |
| `collapse` | Make the callout collapsible | `false` | `true`, `false` | `collapse: true` |

You can start using custom callouts in your Quarto project immediately after installation. First, define your custom callouts in the YAML front matter:

```yaml
custom-callout:
  todo:
    icon-symbol: "üìù"
    color: "pink"
  thumbs-up:
    title: "Great job!"
    icon-symbol: "fa-thumbs-up"
    color: "#008000"
filters:
- custom-callout
```


Then, use the custom callouts in your Quarto documents like this:

```markdown
::: todo

:::

::: thumbs-up

:::

::: {.todo title="Collapsed Custom Todo (Click to Expand)" collapse="true"}
This is a custom 'todo' callout that is collapsible and has a custom title.
:::
```
