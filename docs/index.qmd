The `custom-callout` extension enhances Quarto's built-in callout functionality by allowing you to
create and use custom callouts in your Quarto documents. With this extension, you can define your 
own callout types with custom colors, icons, and appearances.

## Installation

To install the `custom-callout` extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your Quarto project directory.
3. Execute the following command:

```bash
quarto add username/custom-callout
```

This command will download and install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory of your Quarto project. 
If you're using version control, make sure to include this directory in your repository.

## Usage

The `custom-callout` extension allows you to define custom callouts in your YAML front matter and then use them in your Quarto documents.
Here's a quick overview of the available YAML options:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `title` | Default title for the callout (optional) | `title: "Important Note"` |
| `icon` | Use a default icon (optional) | `icon: true` |
| `icon-symbol` | Custom symbol or text for the icon | `icon-symbol: "üìù"` |
| `color` | Color for the callout's left border and icon | `color: "#FFA500"` |
| `appearance` | Callout appearance (optional) | `appearance: simple` |
| `collapse` | Make the callout collapsible (optional) | `collapse: true` |

You can start using custom callouts in your Quarto project immediately after installation. First, define your custom callouts in the YAML front matter:

```yaml
custom-callout:
  todo:
    icon-symbol: "üìù"
    color: "pink"
  test:
    title: "Testing Note"
    icon-symbol: "‚ö†Ô∏è"
    color: "#FFA500"
filters:
- custom-callout
```


Then, use the custom callouts in your Markdown content:

```markdown
::: todo
Remember to complete this section.
:::

::: test
This information is crucial for understanding the concept.
:::
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of custom callouts in action:

::: {.todo}
This is a custom 'todo' callout with a pink border and a pencil icon.
:::

::: {.test}
This is a custom 'test' callout with an orange border and a warning icon.
